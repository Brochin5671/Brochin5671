### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Max and in my 5th year, currently attending the University of Guelph for the Computer Science Honours program.

I have a good amount of experience with web-development: **JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML/CSS, GraphQL, SQL, MongoDB, Express, Node and Docker.**

I also have experience with **Python, C and Java** through personal projects and coding challenges.

## Experience

**Clear Software Inc. (7 months)**:

* Delivered 100+ features and fixes leveraging React, JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL and MariaDB to streamline and modernize business processes for an Ontario-based annuity brokerage firm
  
* Developed an Excel service on the applicationâ€™s back-end using TypeScript and NestJS to migrate a Visual
FoxPro process for spreadsheet parsing and data export to templates in order to streamline data management

â€¢ Lead the creation of annuity application pages and forms by building the UI using React, JavaScript and a
custom GraphQL API, resulting in efficient management of annuities for thousands of clients


**TD Bank Group (4 months)**:
â€¢ Contributed to the enhancement of the MBNA online banking web application impacting over 7 million
customers for credit card servicing within the TD Credit Card Product Group

â€¢ Assisted in delivering 50+ Angular UI and Java back-end enhancements by pair programming and
conducting code reviews, leading to successful retrospectives and a reduction in post-deployment issues

â€¢ Refactored and optimized Java back-end code in the banking application resulting in a 10% performance boost
by using several optimization techniques and eliminating bottlenecks

**NCR (4 months)**:

â€¢ Participated in the development of the D3 Banking web applicationâ€™s UI using React, TypeScript and Jest,
which had an impact on over 3 million users using the banking solutions

â€¢ Collaborated with front-end and back-end developers to open and merge 50+ pull requests, that consisted of
features, fixes and refactors for several releases of the application used by a dozen banks and credit unions

â€¢ Revamped the architecture of the UI by refactoring 150+ components into shared libraries and to use Reduxâ€™s
state container, which improved maintainability and reduced code duplication for better performance

**University of Guelph (4 months)**:

â€¢ Collaborated on the Global Burden of Animal Diseases project funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, aimed at understanding and mitigating the impact of animal diseases on global health and agriculture

â€¢ Developed Python scripts to extract, clean, and standardize extensive Ethiopian livestock and aquaculture data
from PDF tables, streamlining the data governance process, and facilitating data analysis and reporting

â€¢ Demonstrated a proof-of-concept solution for providing analytical data to the World Health Organization by using
Amazon RDS to maintain a PostgreSQL database spanning two decades of Ethiopian livestock data
