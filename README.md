### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Max and in my 5th year, currently attending the University of Guelph for the Computer Science Honours program.

I have a good amount of experience with web-development: **JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML/CSS, GraphQL, SQL, MongoDB, Express, Node and Docker.**

I also have experience with **Python, C, Java and C#** through personal projects and coding challenges.

## Experience

**Clear Software Inc. (7 months)**: Used **React**, **GraphQL** and **TypeScript** to migrate complex business processes for an Ontario-based annuity broker

**TD Bank Group (4 months)**: Contributed to the MBNA online banking application by assisting in delivering 50+ **Angular** UI and **Java** back-end enhancements which led to improved performance by 10%, benefiting over 7 million customers.

**NCR (4 months)**: Developed and enhanced the D3 Banking web app used by over 3 million users, using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Redux**, and **Jest**. This involved collaborating with cross-functional teams, contributing with 50+ pull requests, and revamping UI architecture to improve performance and scalability for across 7 banks.

**University of Guelph (4 months)**: Collaborated on the Global Burden of Animal Diseases project with a professor, contributing to the extraction and standardization of extensive Ethiopian livestock and aquaculture data for analysis. I also implemented a proof-of-concept solution using **Amazon RDS** to maintain a **PostgreSQL** database of two decades of Ethiopian livestock data for analytical purposes to the World Health Organization.
